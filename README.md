# Iris-Flower-Detection

INTRODUCTION

Detecting iris flowers typically refers to the task of classifying iris flowers into different species based on their features. The Iris flower dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning, often used for practicing classification algorithms. The dataset consists of measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

Library used are as follows-

1.NumPy

2.Pandas

3.scikit-learn

4.Matplotlib

5.Seaborn


Problem Statement:

Design and implement a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width measurements. The objective is to create a reliable model that can accurately identify the species of iris flowers, considering the provided dataset. The model's performance should be evaluated using appropriate metrics, and the final implementation should allow for the efficient prediction of iris flower species for new measurements.
